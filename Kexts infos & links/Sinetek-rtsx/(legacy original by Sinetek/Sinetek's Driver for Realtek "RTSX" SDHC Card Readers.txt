Driver for Realtek "RTSX" SDHC Card Readers

Posted February 11, 2017 by Sinetek:
This driver is for Realtek SDHC card readers on a PCI/PCIe bus, most commonly found in laptops.

I would like to get testers. The driver is not yet finalized, but I'm making the thread now anyway since there was interest. Expect this post to change in the future.

Things to fix eventually:
 - get more pci id's in plist
- async task in its own thread instead of blocking the os
- prealloc DMA buffer?
- cards with sector_size != 512, haven't been tested at all.
- clean up src. git push.
- power management? what happens when you sleep the machine?
- the eject button in finder is broken, do not use for now.
- spams the syslog with debug messages. release config?
- basic namespace pollution a bit out of hand
 
Update 2 May 4, 2019:
hey folks! long time no see, but i have some positive news this time. I found out the proper way to implement this driver, so i'll be making a new attempt at it using the latest openBSD source.

To make a long story short, i was instantiating all sorts of iokit objects improperly... dumb.

Today i worked on a proof of concept thinger to verify the macOS side of things, and that's confirmed working. So ya; like the messaging calls between my driver and the rest of the IOKit stack.

It takes me a lot of time to write these drivers, if you would like to support my work, please kindly consider making a donation. With this driver it is possible we'll be able to boot macOS and use macOS on our SD cards :P

Wouldn't go far without all your help, if only testing!!
