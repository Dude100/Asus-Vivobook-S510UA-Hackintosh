# BCM94360CS2 Wi-Fi/ BT card + NGFF M.2 Adapter Installation Instructions


by demand. If you need instructions, let me know below and I should be able to post the manual incl. photos in a timely manner.

**Be aware that this procedure _does_ require you to have a rotary tool (Dremel and alike) and do a bit of grinding on the adapter to make it fit into the VidoBook!!!**

It is <ins>crucial</ins> you _DO_ **follow my installation instructions step-by-step 100%**, otherwise you _WILL **brick**_ your VivoBook's motherboard!
